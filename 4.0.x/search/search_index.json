Something broke or simply isn't working as expected! That's OK. Usually its possible to recover from almost any type of error. The only thing that you can't recover from is not making database backups! There are a few things you can do to perform general troubleshooting. These range from flipping SeAT into debug mode to simply running a self diagnostics command. Lets take a look at a few steps you can take: Whoops \u00b6 Whoops, looks like something went wrong. The dreaded \"Whoops\" message has appeared and now you need to figure out why. Normally, this means that something serious broke and the application simply can't recover by itself. In many cases it could either be a quick fix you can do yourself, or something that could result in the need to fix some code. In either case, the next steps to perform when seeing this would be to either enable debug mode and reloading the page / request that failed, or by viewing the log file while retrying the failed request. Enabling Debug Mode \u00b6 Debug mode controls how much information about an error condition is displayed to the user. When debug mode is enabled, the error message will be extremely verbose , whereas when its disabled, it simply states that an error had occurred. In either case, the error will always be written to the logs. By default, SeAT does not have debug mode enabled. There are many reasons for this with the primary reason being security related. It goes without saying that once you have completed debugging and fixing your instance, always make sure you disable debug mode afterwards. Once you have enabled debug mode, any errors that may occur would look something like the following instead of the default \"Whoops\" message. Depending on if you have development packages installed (which you wouldn't by default in non-development installations), the debug page may look slightly different. Irrespective of how you installed SeAT, enabling debug mode is always a matter of changing the APP_DEBUG configuration option in the .env to `true. However, for it to apply depends on how you installed, so follow the appropriate steps below. Debug Mode - Host Installs \u00b6 Assuming you installed SeAT on your host using either the SeAT tool or manually, cd to your SeAT installation directory. If you followed the guides on this documentation website, that would be in /var/www/seat . Next, open the .env file in a text editor and modify the line that says APP_DEBUG=false to say APP_DEBUG=true . The change would immediately take effect and you can simply reload the failed request for a detailed error message and code stack trace. Debug Mode - Docker Installs \u00b6 If you installed using Docker, cd to the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located. Assuming you followed the guides on this website, that would be in /opt/seat-docker . Next, open the .env file in a text editor and modify the line that says APP_DEBUG=false to say APP_DEBUG=true . For the change to take effect, you need to reload the stack with docker-compose up -d from within the same folder. The containers will take a few moments to settle down after which you can reload the failed the request for a detailed error message and code stack trace. Checking Log Files \u00b6 Logs are always written to one of two log files irrespective of whether the application is in debug mode or not. Application logs go to the Laravel frameworks log files. API requests sent to ESI are stored int he Eseye log file. Logs are stored in the applications storage directory which can be found in the storage/logs folder. Assuming you followed the guides on this documentation site, the full path to the directory where log files are will be /var/www/seat/storage/logs/ . In the case of Docker installations, this will also be the path within the seat-app container. Log files are rotated daily and are kept for a maximum of 10 days by default. Therefore, to get to todays application logs, the log file itself may be called laravel-2018-05-31.log . To find todays ESI requests logs, the log file will be called eseye-2018-05-31.log . Live Logs - Host Installs \u00b6 Irrespective of which log file you want to look at, getting todays live logs written to screen can be done with the following commands: Application Logs: tail -f /var/www/seat/storage/logs/laravel- $( date +%Y-%m-%d ) .log Esye / ESI Logs: tail -f /var/www/seat/storage/logs/eseye- $( date +%Y-%m-%d ) .log Live Logs - Docker Installs \u00b6 Application source code and log files are shared between the seat-app , seat-worker and seat-cron containers. Therefore the following commands can be executed on any of those containers. For purposes of demonstration, we are going to tail the logs from the seat-app container. First, enter get a shell within the seat-app container while in the /opt/seat-docker/ directory with: docker-compose exec seat-app sh Next, tail the log files you want to see. Application Logs: tail -f /var/www/seat/storage/logs/laravel- $( date +%Y-%m-%d ) .log Esye / ESI Logs: tail -f /var/www/seat/storage/logs/eseye- $( date +%Y-%m-%d ) .log Diagnose command \u00b6 A diagnostics command exists that aims to perform a number of self-checks to help you diagnose problems. This command should be run as the same user the SeAT workers are running as, which is typically either www-data on Ubuntu / Debian based systems and nginx on CentOS based systems. If you have created yourself a separate user for SeAT, then running the diagnose command as that user is what you need to do. Diagnose - Host Installs \u00b6 Host installs require you to first cd to the directory where you installed SeAT. If you followed the guides on this website, that would be /var/www/seat . Next, run the diagnose command as the user you are running the workers as. If you are the root user, you can run it with: su -c 'php artisan seat:admin:diagnose' -s /bin/sh www-data Diagnose - Docker Installs \u00b6 For Docker installations, the only requirement to run the diagnose command would be to ensure that you are currently in the same folder as that where the stacks docker-compose.yml file lives. If you followed the guides on this website that would be in /opt/seat-docker . Next, run the command with: docker-compose exec seat-app su -c 'php artisan seat:admin:diagnose' -s /bin/sh www-data","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#troubleshooting","text":"So the inevitable happened.

Be it because you would like to configure TLS for the web interface, change the port of the SeAT webserver or simply generate an admin login URL, this guide aims to help you get familiar for the commands needed for this. Many of the commands are exactly the same as those used in a bare metal installation, except for the fact that they are always prefixed with docker-compose and run from the same directory that you have the seat docker-compose.yml file stored. If your docker-compose.yml lives in /opt/seat-docker , you will need to cd to that directory first and then execute the docker-compose commands. Container Status \u00b6 For a quick, birds-eye view on the status of the containers within the SeAT docker stack, the following command may be run: docker-compose ps This should give you the name, entry point, current status and internal ports used within the docker network as output. Admin Login \u00b6 Administrative access to SeAT has changed dramatically since version 3. It is no longer possible to login using a traditional username and password combination, but instead only using EVE Online SSO. It is possible to gain access to an administrator user via a one time generated login URL. Run the following command to generate an admin login URL: docker-compose exec seat-app php artisan seat:admin:login This will generate an admin user with the necessary roles as well as produce a URL you can use to login to your SeAT instance as an administrator. Warning If your instance shows the URL as http://localhost/auth/login/admin/RANDOM__TOKEN it means that you have not yet configured the URL where your SeAT instance is accessible from in the .env file. In this case, just copy the part after the /auth (with the token) into your browsers URL bar and submit the request to login. Note Generally, you would probably only do this once and then add your EVE Online character to the Superusers role for future use. Configuration Changes \u00b6 A dockerized installation of SeAT is primarily configured via a configuration file located at .env . Configuration options such as your applications SSO secrets, SeAT's web server ports are amongst the many configuration options available in this file. Making changes to this file requires the docker stack to be restarted so that the configuration may be applies. An example case would be when you configure SSO for your instance. Once you have made a configuration change, save the .env file and restart the stack by simply running the following command from the path where the docker-compose.yml lives: docker-compose up -d Live Container Logs \u00b6 Getting an idea of what is happening inside of the containers may be useful for many things, including debugging any issues that may occur. All of the containers generate logs that can be viewed either in isolation, or all of the containers in the stack. To view a single containers logs ( seat-app in this examples case), run: docker-compose logs --tail 10 -f seat-app To view all containers logs at once, run: docker-compose logs --tail 10 -f Once you are done viewing the output, simply pressing ^C will exit the log viewer. Installing Plugins \u00b6 SeAT provides the ability for third party developers to integrate with the core environment to extend its features and functionality. It is possible to install those plugins in a docker environment. Installing a plugin is relatively easy too. All you need to do is add the plugin name to your SEAT_PLUGINS variable in the .env file and run docker-compose up -d again. The plugin will be read from the .env file and installed as the application container starts. For example. Open the .env file (which is most probably at /opt/seat-docker/.env ) and edit the SEAT_PLUGINS variable to include the package you want to install. In our example we use the pseudo package called user/seat-plugin: # SeAT Plugins # This is a list of the all of the third party plugins that you # would like to install as part of SeAT. Package names should be # comma separated if multiple packages should be installed. SEAT_PLUGINS=user/seat-plugin Save your .env file and run docker-compose up -d to restart the stack with the new plugins as part of it. Depending on how big the plugin itself may be, this could take a few moments to complete. You can monitor the installation process by running: docker-compose logs --tail 5 -f seat-app Database Backups and Restore \u00b6 Backups. They are important and really simple to do. To perform a backup of the current database used within the docker stack, compressing and saving it to a file called seat_backup.sql.gz , run: docker-compose exec mariadb sh -c 'exec mysqldump \"$MYSQL_DATABASE\" -u\"$MYSQL_USER\" -p\"$MYSQL_PASSWORD\"' | gzip > seat_backup.sql.gz To restore a backup to a new dockerized instance of SeAT, run: zcat seat_backup.sql.gz | docker-compose exec -T mariadb sh -c 'exec mysql \"$MYSQL_DATABASE\" -u\"$MYSQL_USER\" -p\"$MYSQL_PASSWORD\"' Performing Updates \u00b6 As expected, updates for SeAT are deployed via Dockerhub and the images within the eveseat organization . Every package version release will automatically start the build process to generate a new docker image. This means updates are suuuper simple in the docker world. To update your instance, simply run: # Update to the latest dockerhub images docker-compose pull # Apply the updates to your instllation docker-compose up -d # Cleanup any dangling images docker image prune -f Better safe then sorry Always perform a backup of your database before doing an update. Always.","title":"Docker Admin"},{"location":"admin_guides/docker_admin/#docker-administration","text":"Occasionally you will need to perform administrative tasks in your SeAT instance running within docker.

This allows for SeAT administrators to granularly control who has access to what based on which roles a SeAT user has. Definitions \u00b6 This section aims to clear up the definitions used in the SeAT RBAC implementation. User A SeAT user account. This can be either a user account that was created in SeAT itself, or an automatically created account based on SSO. The only difference between the accounts is that with an SSO account, SeAT has no idea what the accounts password is. Otherwise, everything else is exactly the same. Permission A Permission is an attribute that is assigned to a Role . It grants access based on the specific permission. Role A Role is simply a collection of permissions. Users get assigned a roles and inherit the permissions granted by that role. A user can not be given a raw permission. Permissions can only be granted my creating a Role, assigning permissions to the Role and granting the role to a user. Affiliation Affiliations allow administrators to set permissions bound to a specific entity. When configuring a role, permissions are granted to the role. When the an affiliation is set, the role effectively gives the permissions to the specified entities in the affiliation list. Not all roles are affected by affiliations. By default, only Corporation and Character roles are affected by affiliations. Entity An entity is either a Character or a Corporation identified by its unique ID. Example: Corporation accountant \u00b6 Lets assume you wanted to create a role for a corporation accountant. To acheive this, you would do the following: Create a new role. Name it something like Corporation Accountant . Edit the new role, and grant it the Corporation.ledger , Corporation.walletJournal , Corporation.transactions and Corporation.summary (to view the sheet) permissions. Next, affiliate the role with the corporation(s) for whom this role should act as an accountant. Optionally, assign some users to the role. You can assign users at a later stage too. Roles and assigning corporation members Automatically assigning users to a role based on ingame role, title or corporation/alliance membership is not part of the core SeAT packages and to do this you would need a SeAT plugin like herpaderpaldent/seat-groups . Affiliation does not give permissions to users, but restricts access to use given permissions only on specified entities. Your configured role from the above example may now look as follows: Users assigned this role would be able to see corporation ledger, corporation wallet journal, corporation transactions and corporation summary pages of the affiliated corp 'The Warp Core Stabilizers'.

Thankfully, it is actually very easy to scale SeAT horizontally in order to improve performance. This document aims to share some need to knows before embarking on a tiered installation of SeAT. Definitions \u00b6 Lets get some definitions cleared up. Server \u00b6 A server is defined as any VPS, hardware, docker container, or other form of virtualization. When talking performance though, keep in mind that there will probably be very little performance gains when everything runs on the same physical hardware instance. SeAT component \u00b6 A SeAT Component is a collection of SeAT packages and configurations that is responsible for performing a specific task. Tasks include the SeAT Web Interface, the job workers or dispatchers. Components \u00b6 Before we can talk scale, we need to understand which components SeAT actually consists of. We will not talk about the immutable resources here as they will be mentioned in the next section. So, which components are there to SeAT? The web front end. The queue workers. The job dispatcher. Each of these components can live on their own server and must share the same immutable resources . Immutable resources \u00b6 While almost every component in SeAT can 'run on its own', there are some services that SeAT consumes that SeAT can not scale itself. Instead, SeAT can consume a clustered or load balanced instance of these services. There are various reasons for this where the most important is that state is maintained between queue workers using Redis and MariaDB. Services that should be shared between all SeAT components are: The Redis cache. The MariaDB database. When mentioning these components, they can definitely exist in their clustered/load balanced forms. For Redis, have a look at their Redis cluster tutorial and for MariaDB, you can have a look at their MariaDB cluster installation . Simple scaled setup \u00b6 The following example setup is probably the most simple option to gain performance improvements by scaling out. The gist of it is that we simply add more queue worker components to the SeAT setup. Lets start by taking a look at a diagram, showing the extra queue worker component added. Installing a new server with only the queue worker component setup can bring a significant speed boost into the environment. A new queue worker could be configured to run an extra 4-6 jobs. This queue worker must be configured to make use of the immutable resources . More complicated scaled setup \u00b6 Of course, one can totally go full nelson and explode all of the components in use. Below is an example deployment (with data flow links, red for redis, blue for MariaDB) that shows how each SeAT component can live on its own server. Component setups \u00b6 Lets talk about component configurations quickly. Apart from the immutable resources , all of the software needed can be sourced from SeAT packages. All of the standard requirements such as PHP7.1 and Supervisor 3 also apply. However, not all components would need a web server for example. Below are the descriptions (and short requirements list) for the different SeAT components. Web front end \u00b6 To setup a web front end component, use the following steps: Ensure you have at least PHP7.1 installed. Ensure that you have a web server installed that can serve the public/ directory from the SeAT project. Ensure that you have composer installed and available in PATH . Download SeAT somewhere like /var/www/seat using composer create-project eveseat/seat /var/www/seat --no-dev . Once installed, configure the .env files database and Redis settings to connect to your immutable sources . Queue worker \u00b6 To setup a queue worker component, use the following steps: Ensure you have at least PHP7.1 installed. Ensure that you have supervisor3 installed. Ensure that you have composer installed and available in PATH . Download SeAT somewhere using composer create-project eveseat/seat --no-dev . Once installed, configure the .env files database and Redis settings to connect to your immutable sources . Configure the workers in a seat.ini file for supervisor to start. Job dispatcher \u00b6 To setup a job dispatcher component, use the following steps: Ensure you have at least PHP7.1 installed. Ensure that you have composer installed and available in PATH . Download SeAT somewhere like /var/www/seat using composer create-project eveseat/seat /var/www/seat --no-dev .

This document aims to explain in as much detail as possible how it has been implemented in SeAT, as well as what is tracked and what is not. This document aims to be as transparent as possible. Why \u00b6 Well, the most obvious is it being nice to know how much SeAT is actually being used. One may argue that Github & packagist gives statistics on how many times the project has been installed / cloned, but that does not really reflect how many actual active installations there are. Knowing how many active installs there are, encourages development. Lastly, certain exception types are also sent as hits. This helps immensely with figuring out if a new version may have a serious bug. How its implemented \u00b6 First of all, the Google Analytics Measurement Protocol is really just that. It just measures usage. In summary, when certain events happen, only a hit with what happened is sent. No other data is sent with the hit. For example. When the scheduler queues jobs, a hit is sent that says that this happened, and that it happened for x amount of keys. This can be seen in the following line of code: QueueKeys . It can also be seen that no other data goes along with the hit. For example, the access_token and refresh_token (which is what most will be worried about) does not go with the hit. Once a hit is getting ready to be sent, information such as which OS/Version as well as versions of installed SeAT packages gets sent along with the hit. This can be seen in the following lines of code . How are you protecting my privacy? \u00b6 Very special care has been taken to ensure that no personally identifiable information goes along with the Measurement Protocol hits.

This document aims to explain in as much detail as possible how it has been implemented in SeAT, as well as what is tracked and what is not. This document aims to be as transparent as possible.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"admin_guides/understanding_tracking/#why","text":"Well, the most obvious is it being nice to know how much SeAT is actually being used. One may argue that Github & packagist gives statistics on how many times the project has been installed / cloned, but that does not really reflect how many actual active installations there are. Knowing how many active installs there are, encourages development. Lastly, certain exception types are also sent as hits. This helps immensely with figuring out if a new version may have a serious bug.","title":"Why"},{"location":"admin_guides/understanding_tracking/#how-its-implemented","text":"First of all, the Google Analytics Measurement Protocol is really just that. It just measures usage. In summary, when certain events happen, only a hit with what happened is sent. No other data is sent with the hit. For example. When the scheduler queues jobs, a hit is sent that says that this happened, and that it happened for x amount of keys. This can be seen in the following line of code: QueueKeys . It can also be seen that no other data goes along with the hit. For example, the access_token and refresh_token (which is what most will be worried about) does not go with the hit. Once a hit is getting ready to be sent, information such as which OS/Version as well as versions of installed SeAT packages gets sent along with the hit. This can be seen in the following lines of code .","title":"How its implemented"},{"location":"admin_guides/understanding_tracking/#how-are-you-protecting-my-privacy","text":"Very special care has been taken to ensure that no personally identifiable information goes along with the Measurement Protocol hits.

To give some perspective, we have to have a quick look at how packages are built and bootstrapped. Quick-n-dirty-package summary \u00b6 All of SeAT's core internals are built as packages. This means, every package has a service provider. All a service provider really is, is a class with 2 methods ie: handle() and register() . When a service provider is bootstrapped into the application, these 2 methods are called at some stage. It is in these methods that we tell the Laravel framework more about our package. Amongst many things that we can tell it, one of them is configuration related. All we really telling the application is where the configuration file is, and under which namespace does it live. Another important fact is that SeAT package configurations are added with the mergeConfigFrom() method. This means, you can override the defaults in your installation without worrying about breaking the package itself. Overriding configuration \u00b6 Lets take a look at a sample package configuration file: The eveseat/eveapi package for example. At the time of this writing, it has 5 configuration options. The first being a version , the last being eseye_loglevel . When this package is installed, this configuration file will live somewhere deep inside your vendor folder. Changing the value there is not impossible, but it will be lost with the next package upgrade. The better method will be to override the change locally, inside you config/ folder here . An example, changing eseye_loglevel \u00b6 To start, create the file eveapi.config.php inside the config folder. Next, we add the contents in the file to return an array, specifying the eseye_loglevel key and its new value. The file would look something like this: <?php // File: config/eveapi.config.php return [ 'eseye_loglevel' => 'debug' , ]; That's it.

The following list contains some tips to help you avoid those conflicts and to help people better discover your packages: Prefix your github repository name with seat eg: seat-teamspeak . Tag your github repository with seat . Use a unique package namespace such as Author\\Seat\\Package\\ eg: Warlof\\Seat\\Teamspeak\\ . Prefix your database table names with something unique to your package. eg warlof_teamspeak_users . Do not modify core tables. This will break future updates for users of your package.

In your composer.json file, set the type to seat-plugin . Model Observers \u00b6 Depending on what your package does, it may be interesting for you to know when data is created / deleted. Given that SeAT makes use of Laravel, you have the ability to subscribe to events that occur on any model within SeAT. For example, should a User model get deleted, the deleted event will get fired. Writing an observer class and subscribing to it with \\Seat\\Web\\Models\\User::observer(\\My\\Namespace\\UserObserver::class) will allow you to define a deleted() method inside of your observer class and perform extra logic with the User that got deleted.

This of course will install all of the sources in the projects vendor/ directory, though this is not always ideal from a development perspective.

The following flow is generally how I work on the SeAT packages: From the main seat project, create a sub folder called packages . For clarities sake, this folder will be at the same level as say the app folder as well as the composer.json file. Next, I like to create the vendors directory for the package I am going to work on, so, create a folder in under packages and call it eveseat . (This is optional. If you skip it, make sure you keep that in mind when setting up the autoloader later). Clone your fork under the eveseat folder. Next, we move back to the original composer.json file, and add the following for PSR-4 class mapping (for the eveapi package): \"psr-4\" : { \"App\\\\\" : \"app/\" , \"Seat\\\\Eveapi\\\\\" : \"packages/eveseat/eveapi/src/\" } Set up the autoloader by running composer dump-autoload You should now have the Seat\\Eveapi namespace autoloaded and ready for your testing :D Take special note of any dependencies that may be missing.

Hopefully this guide helps you along the way! This guide was written while writing the API package for SeAT here . I figured it would be best to try and capture the process to help in case I miss any important details. Be sure to also have a look at the Development Tips page! Background notes \u00b6 I think its important to keep in mind a few things about how SeAT is put together. The most important being a brief description of what each core package offers, and how you can integrate with them. For a breakdown on what the core packages provide, please refer the to [breakdown]. SeAT 3 is written on Laravel 5.5 . A very good thing to do would be to actually read the documentation top->bottom and get an idea of what is possible with the framework. SeAT core packages make heavy use of many of the features, based directly of what has been interpreted by this very documentation. If you really want to start contributing packages, but juts cant get your head around this whole Laravel thing, then I can suggest you have a look at this excellent free course material covering the basics of what you will encounter in the SeAT codebase. https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-5-fundamentals Getting started \u00b6 The very first thing to do is prepare the empty git repository on say Github, as well as the composer package itself. Clone a clean repository, and run composer init , answering any questions. Once that is done, edit the resultant composer.json and prepare the autoload block. SeAT core follows the PSR-4 autoloading standard. I will suggest you do the same. For some more detailed composer info, refer to the docs here . For the API package, I am going to autoload Seat\\Api from the src directory using PSR-4. Service provider \u00b6 As mentioned in the package breakdowns , the eveseat/seat repository bootstraps packages via service providers or package discovery. This is actually a Laravel convention that SeAT just follows. To get our package ready, we need to create a service provider. Thankfully there is a command to stub a new one for us. For the API package, I just ran php artisan make:provider ApiServiceProvider and copied the resultant file from app/Providers to my packages src/ directory. Our packages file structure now looks as follows: \u251c\u2500\u2500 composer.json \u2514\u2500\u2500 src \u2514\u2500\u2500 ApiServiceProvider.php Package structure \u00b6 From here you pretty much free to do what you want. How you structure the package will obviously depend on what exactly your package provides. In principle, I prefer to follow the same package structure as Laravel does for web / console features. Since we are going to be providing web features with the API, we will quickly create a few folders in preparation for this. I know beforehand that we are going to need a model to store API tokens; middleware to authenticate API requests; routes and controllers for the actual api logic (preferably making use of the eveapi/services repository classes for data access) as well as a few web views for administrators to generate API tokens for applications. With that in mind, the initial structure looks as follows: \u251c\u2500\u2500 composer.json \u2514\u2500\u2500 src \u251c\u2500\u2500 ApiServiceProvider.php \u251c\u2500\u2500 Config \u251c\u2500\u2500 Http \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Controllers \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Middleware \u251c\u2500\u2500 Models \u251c\u2500\u2500 database \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 migrations \u2514\u2500\u2500 resources \u2514\u2500\u2500 views This will obviously change as we progress building the package. Routes and controllers \u00b6 To start testing the API, we need to add a route and controller to process some requests and responses. My routes.php file will have a global Route::group() to encapsulate the routes in the Seat\\Api namespace as well as prefix them with api/ . // File: routes.php Route::group([ 'namespace' => 'Seat\\Api\\Http\\Controllers', 'prefix' => 'api' ], function () { // Logic here }); See the final product here for a more complete example. Next, I add some logic with a route to / , update the base frameworks composer.json to autoload the Seat\\Api namespace from the directory where my package lives, run composer dump-autoload and add the service provider to the eveseat/seat repositories app.php providers array. Lastly, I add a method to the service provider to load the routes and call it form the boot() method in the generated stub. See the complete service provider here /** * Include the routes */ public function add_routes() { if (!$this->app->routesAreCached()) { include __DIR__ . '/Http/routes.php'; } } As a final test, I check that my route is accessible from a booted SeAT app. :) Routes \u00b6 Access Control \u00b6 Obviously, some routes are not for everyone's eyes. SeAT comes with middleware that can be used to filter out requests that may not be authorized for your route. As can be seen in the example below (from here ), we are filtering out requests to api-admin for only superusers. Route::group([ 'namespace' => 'Admin', 'middleware' => 'bouncer:superuser', // The ACL specification. 'prefix' => 'api-admin' ], function () { Route::get('/', [ 'as' => 'api-admin.list', 'uses' => 'ApiAdminController@listTokens']); }); I suggest you have a look at the eveseat/web packages routes definitions for more examples on how the middleware is used. https://github.com/eveseat/web/tree/master/src/Http/Routes Middleware \u00b6 To auth our API requests, we are going to go with token based authentication for now. We want users to present us with a X-Token header (from a valid allowed src IP address) before they may proceed with their request. To do this, we will filter requests using middleware. Thankfully, again, Laravel comes with a command to stub us some empty middleware. Run php artisan make:middleware ApiToken and copy it to your projects Middleware folder. Next we should register the middleware in our service provider. I do this by adding a method and calling it in boot() . See the complete middleware here /** * Include the middleware needed * * @param $router */ public function add_middleware($router) { // Authenticate checks that the token is valid // from an allowed IP address $router->middleware('api.auth', ApiToken::class); } Views \u00b6 Although almost all of our interfacing with this package will be via the json api endpoints, we need to add a few routes that will give an administrator the ability to generate API tokens as well as view logs etc. This will be for an administrator, so we will re-use the ACL features provided by the eveseat/web package to ensure that only admins an access our api-admin routes. Views live in resources/views and are bootstrapped to the api namespace in the service provider. See the service provider here for an example. Note how we are re-using views that exist in the web namespace. All we have to do is extend one of the grids like here and start without our blade template. Sidebar menu \u00b6 Integrating with the sidebar is also really easy. All you have to do is create a config file, bootstrap it in the service provider and viola. The config file itself has a set structure for the web package to interpret and can be seen here . return [ 'api' => [ 'permission' => 'Superuser', 'name' => 'Api Tokens', 'icon' => 'fa-exchange', 'route_segment' => 'api-admin', 'entries' => [ [ // Manage API Tokens 'name' => 'Manage', 'icon' => 'fa-key', 'route' => 'api-admin.list' ] ] ] ]; The format is generally an array, whereby the first key is the name of your package ( api in this case). Thereafter you can specify the main entry, and any sub entries you want to add. The route key should refer to the named route. The sidebar loader will resolve the route itself for you. If you have any permissions requirements for your package, the permission key can be used together with a required SeAT permission to render the view. Character submenus \u00b6 Integrating with the character sub menus is also really easy. Just like the sidebar, all you have to do is create a config file, bootstrap it in the service provider and viola. The namespace should be named package.character.menu in your service provider. A sample config file can be seen below: // file: package.character.menu.php return [ [ 'name' => 'Research', 'permission' => 'character.research', 'highlight_view' => 'research', 'route' => 'character.view.research' ] ]; Corporation submenus \u00b6 Integrating with the corporation sub menus is also really easy. Just like the sidebar and character menus, all you have to do is create a config file, bootstrap it in the service provider and viola. The namespace should be named package.corporation.menu in your service provider. A sample config file can be seen below: // file: package.corporation.menu.php return [ [ 'name' => 'Research', 'permission' => 'corporation.research', 'highlight_view' => 'research', 'route' => 'corporation.view.research' ] ]; Bootstrapping menu items \u00b6 In the above items, we refer to the files needing to be bootstrapped via the service provider. All this really means is that we have to tell the Laravel application where to find configuration information for a namespace. So, if we wanted to add a sidebar item, we would add the following line to the register() method of the service provider: // Include this packages menu items $this->mergeConfigFrom(__DIR__ . '/Config/package.sidebar.php', 'package.sidebar'); The first argument is the file with the sidebar definitions, the second is the namespace. Database \u00b6 For our API package, we have a database requirement. We need to store api tokens and the ip address that is allowed to use them. We are also going to store an access log (based on the config setting). We create migrations and models just like you would for a base Laravel 5.1 application. The only thing to remember is that your migrations for your package must be published (and specified in your service provider).","title":"Package Development"},{"location":"developer_guides/package_development/#developers-guides-package-development","text":"","title":"Developers Guides - Package Development"},{"location":"developer_guides/package_development/#introduction","text":"So, you want to write a SeAT package?

Endpoints are protected by an access token that is limited by IP address. For every IP address that wants to make API requests to SeAT, a unique token is required. API Tokens have no concept of ACL's. The API should primarily be used for integrations with other systems. Definitions \u00b6 Currently, all API endpoints live at <seat url>/api/<version> where <seat url> is the full url to your SeAT instance and <version> is the API version you wish to interact with. Since SeAT 3.0, API documentation is generated from source code annotations and presented via a Swagger UI. As a result, endpoint documentation is now directly available on your instance at the following address <seat url>/api/documentation . A link to the documentation is also provided on the API key management page available to users with the Superuser role. Swagger JSON If you get an error when viewing the API documentation that complains about a file called api-docs.json , make sure that you ran the php artisan l5-swagger:generate command as part of the installation and upgrade routines. Authentication \u00b6 Authentication to the SeAT API is done via a X-Token header. A token may be obtained by browsing to the API settings page in the SeAT WebUI and generating one. A sample request using curl with an authentication token can be seen below: $ curl -X GET -H \"X-Token:123456\" -H \"Accept: application/json\" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/key * Trying ::1... * Connected to localhost ( ::1 ) port 8000 ( #0) > GET /api/v1/key HTTP/1.1 > Host: localhost:8000 > User-Agent: curl/7.43.0 > Accept: application/json > X-Token:123456 > < HTTP/1.1 200 OK < Host: localhost:8000 < Connection: close < Cache-Control: no-cache < Date: Sat, 28 Nov 2015 22 :27:12 GMT < Content-Type: application/json Content-Type \u00b6 Make sure you specify the Accepted content-type header as application/json .

Generally, these are the best ways to getting started with SeAT. There are two options for you to choose from, which include a Docker setup or a host-based setup. If you would prefer less automation, or you already have existing services on your server which may interfere with SeAT, check out some of the advanced installation guides. Installation \u00b6 Note Make sure you review the hardware requirements before installing anything intended for production use! Docker Installation \u00b6 Using docker, all of SeAT's dependencies is neatly abstracted away from your hosts operating system and does not conflict with any pre-existing software you might have on your server.

Docker enables us to run SeAT on any platform capable of running docker itself (which includes Windows!). Additionally, upgrades and service maintenance is really low effort as you don't have to care about any dependencies. All of it is maintained within a docker stack and dockerhub. Info If you feel like docker might not be your cup of tea, checkout some of the getting started guides that are available. Docker Requirements \u00b6 In terms of performance, the same hardware requirements apply to docker installations as others. For information about the hardware requirements for SeAT, please see this page. The only major difference between docker and other installation options is that the containers themselves may take up a few hundred MB's of extra space. In most cases this should be a non-issue. Warning When considering a VPS provider, make sure you choose one that does not make use of OpenVZ or similar operating-system level virtualization technologies. These virtualization technologies limit you in terms of kernel access as they purely containerize an existing Linux installation. For a successful docker installation, choose a provider that uses para-virtualized technologies such as KVM, VMWare or XEN allowing you full control to the instance (and therefor the kernel itself). Examples of such providers are Digital Ocean , Linode and Vultr . Internal Container Setup Overview \u00b6 The setup for SeAT's docker installation is built on top of docker-compose . With docker-compose, we can use a single docker-compose.yml file to define the entire stack complete with dependencies required to run SeAT. A pre-built and recommended compose file (which is also used by the bootstrapping script) is hosted in the scripts repository here . The previously mentioned compose file is really simple. A high level overview of its contents is: A single docker network called seat-network is defined. All containers are connected to this network and is used as the primary means for inter-container communications. Three volumes are configured to store data. Those are: seat-code : This volume is seeded by the seat-app container and contains the actual SeAT source code. Any container that needs access to the SeAT sources (such as the app and worker containers) would mount this container to their respective, internal /var/www/seat directory. redis-data : This volume is used purely to let redis periodically backup the cache. mariadb-data : This is the most important volume as it contains all of the database data. This is the one volume that you should configure a backup solution for! Six services (or containers) are used within the SeAT docker stack. Two of the services are pulled directly from Dockerhub . Four others are custom build and also hosted on DockerHub. Those containers are exposed in the table bellow : Image Name Image Repository mariadb:10.3 https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/ redis:3 https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/ eveseat/eveseat-nginx https://hub.docker.com/r/eveseat/eveseat-nginx/ eveseat/eveseat-app https://hub.docker.com/r/eveseat/eveseat-app/ eveseat/eveseat-worker https://hub.docker.com/r/eveseat/eveseat-worker/ eveseat/eveseat-cron https://hub.docker.com/r/eveseat/eveseat-cron/ The environment is configured using a top level .env file (not to be confused with the SeAT specific .env file (which should be transparent to a docker user anyways.)) Only two ports are exposed by default. Those are tcp/8080 and tcp/8443 . These can be connected to in order to access the SeAT web interface. All containers are configured to restart on failure, so if your server reboots or a container dies for whatever reason it should automatically start up again. SeAT Docker Installation \u00b6 Depending on wether you already have docker and docker-compose already installed, you may choose how to start the installation. If you already have the required tooling installed and running their latest versions, all you need to do is download the latest docker-compose.yml and .env files to get started. Automated Setup Script \u00b6 If you do not have the required software installed yet, consider running the bootstrap script that will check for docker and docker-compose , install it and start the SeAT stack up for you. The script can be run with: bash < ( curl -fsSL https://git.io/seat-docker ) Once the script is finished, you can skip to the monitoring the stack section of this guide. If you don't want to run this script, follow along in the next section of this guide. Docker Download \u00b6 If you do not have docker , install it now with the following command as root : # Installs docker sh < ( curl -fsSL get.docker.com ) Docker-compose Download \u00b6 If you do not have docker-compose , install it now with the following command as root : # Downloads docker-compose curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.0/docker-compose- $( uname -s ) - $( uname -m ) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose # Makes docker-compose executable chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose Docker compose working directory \u00b6 With docker and docker-compose ready, create yourself a directory in /opt with mkdir -p /opt/seat-docker and cd to it.

You need to cd back to the directory where these are stored in order to be able to execute commands for this stack at a later stage. With the configuration files ready, start up the stack with: docker-compose up -d Yep. Thats all you need to do :) Monitoring the Stack \u00b6 Knowing what is going on inside of your containers is crucial to understanding how everything is running as well as useful when debugging any problems that may occur. While the containers are starting up or have been running for a while, you can always cd to the directory where your docker-compose.yml file lives and run the logs command to see the output of all of the containers in the stack. For example: cd /opt/seat-docker docker-compose logs --tail 10 -f These commands will cd to the directory containing the stacks docker-compose.yml file and run the logs command, showing the last 10 log entries and then printing new ones as they arrive. Configuration Changes \u00b6 All of the relevant configuration lives inside the .env file, next to your docker-compose.yml file. Modify its values by opening it in a text editor, making the appropriate changes and saving it again. Once that is done, run docker-compose up -d again to restart the container environment. If you followed along until now with the docker installation, the next step would be to login as an administrator and to configure SSO. #WIP#","title":"Docker Installation"},{"location":"installation/docker_installation/#docker","text":"As mentioned in numerous other places, docker is ideally the installation route you want to go.

If you really want to run CentOS 6, you would either need to adapt this installation guide with the appropriate init scripts, or use the SeAT tool for installation. Centos 7 \u00b6 This guide attempts to explain how to manually install SeAT onto a CentOS Server. A small amount of Linux experience is preferred when it comes to this guide, although it is not entirely mandatory. Getting started \u00b6 We are going to assume you have root access to a fresh CentOS Server. Typically access is gained via SSH. All of the below commands are to be entered in the SSH terminal session for the installation & configuration of SeAT. If the server you want to install SeAT on is being used for other things too (such as hosting MySQL databases and or websites), then please keep that in mind while following this guide. Packages are installed using the yum package manager as the root user. Eve Application and ESI SeAT 3.0 consumes CCP's ESI service in order to retrieve EVE Online related information. Before you can make any authenticated calls to ESI, you have to register a third party EVE application on the developers portal. This is an absolute must for SeAT to be of any use. The configuration of this step is covered in a later stage of the documentation. OS Installation \u00b6 Operating System \u00b6 Before we get to installing SeAT, lets ensure that your operating system is up to date. We can do that with basics : yum update to update any installed packages. reboot in order to ensure any updated software is the current running version. Repositories \u00b6 Due to the nature of CentOS's packaging and the limitations in getting 'bleeding edge' software with it, we need to add some extra software repositories in order to get SeAT running. The repositories used are the Fedora EPEL repository, Remi repository as well as the MariaDB repository. Install and configure the required repositories with the following commands: EPEL \u00b6 # Download and install EPEL EPEL = epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm && curl -O https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/ $EPEL && yum localinstall -y $EPEL && rm -f $EPEL # Import signing key rpm --import \"http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-7\" Remi \u00b6 # Download and install Epel REMI = remi-release-7.rpm && curl -O http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/ $REMI && yum localinstall -y $REMI && rm -f $REMI # Import signing key rpm --import http://rpms.remirepo.net/RPM-GPG-KEY-remi MariaDB \u00b6 # Configure the MariaDB repository curl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup | bash Repository Configurations \u00b6 Only a small amount of configuration is needed after installing these repositories. Basically, we just want to enable PHP 7.1 for use with SeAT. So, do that with: yum install yum-utils -y && yum-config-manager --enable remi,remi-php71 Database \u00b6 SeAT relies heavily on a database to function. Everything it learns is stored here, along with things such as user accounts for your users. It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required. This document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements. Lets install the database server: yum install mariadb-server With the database server installed, lets start it and configure it to automatically start up the next time our server boots up: systemctl enable mariadb.service && systemctl start mariadb.service Next, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a root password. Note The database root password should not be confused with the operating systems root passwords. They are both completely different. They should also share be the same password. To secure the database, run: mysql_secure_installation This will ask you a series of questions where you should generally just answer yes to. An example run is shown below: [ ... ] Enter current password for root ( enter for none ) : BY DEFAULT IT IS NONE, PRESS ENTER OK, successfully used password, moving on... [ ... ] Set root password? [ Y/n ] y New password: SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE Re-enter new password: SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE Password updated successfully! Reloading privilege tables.. ... Success! [ ... ] Remove anonymous users? [ Y/n ] y ... Success! [ ... ] Disallow root login remotely? [ Y/n ] y ... Success! [ ... ] Remove test database and access to it? [ Y/n ] y [ ... ] Reload privilege tables now? [ Y/n ] y ... Success! [ ... ] That concludes the installation of the database server and securing it. Next, we need to create an actual user and database for SeAT to use on the newly installed server. To do this we use the mysql command line client and enter a few commands as the root user to create the database and the user that will be accessing the server. Let get to it. Fire up the mysql client as root by running: mysql -uroot -p This will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the root account when we ran mysql_secure_installation . This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :) If the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below: root@ubuntu:~# mysql -uroot -p Enter password: Welcome to the MariaDB monitor. Commands end with ; or \\g . Your MariaDB connection id is 16 Copyright ( c ) 2000 , 2018 , Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others. Type 'help;' or '\\h' for help. Type '\\c' to clear the current input statement. MariaDB [( none )] > Create a new database for SeAT to use with: create database seat ; The output should be similar to the below: MariaDB [( none )] > create database seat ; Query OK, 1 row affected ( 0 .00 sec ) Next, we need to create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the new seat database: GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ; Of course, you need to replace s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd with your own unique and strong password. Successfully running this should present you with output similar to the below: MariaDB [( none )] > GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ; Query OK, 0 rows affected ( 0 .00 sec ) In the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as seat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat . Finally, we will flush the database server privileges: FLUSH PRIVILEGES ; That concludes the database server setup. You can exit the prompt with exit ; Note Remember the password for the seat database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT. PHP \u00b6 Since SeAT is written primarily in PHP, we will need to install PHP packages. Currently only PHP 7.1 is supported (and is already enabled via the Remi repository earlier in this guide) due to issues with Laravel (the framework SeAT is built on) and PHP 7.2. This should change in the very near future. Install the required PHP packages now with: yum install -y php php-cli php-mysqlnd php-posix php-mcrypt php-process php-mbstring php-intl php-dom php-gd unzip Redis \u00b6 SeAT makes use of Redis as a cache and message broker for the Queue back end. Installing it is really easy. Do it with: yum install -y redis Next, start it and configure it to auto start next time the server boots up: systemctl enable redis.service && systemctl start redis.service SeAT Installation \u00b6 Prerequisites \u00b6 Excellent progress! All of the operating system level requirements are now met and we are almost ready to install SeAT itself. The only thing that is outstanding is the package manager called composer as well as the git client. The combination of composer and git will let us download the SeAT source code from Github and install it locally. Git \u00b6 Install git with: yum -y install git Composer \u00b6 Next, install composer with: curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir = /usr/local/bin --filename = composer && hash -r Thats it. Lets install SeAT! By default, we suggest you run SeAT from within /var/www/seat . As part of the installation, the seat directory will be created for us, but we will need to create /var/www for now as we have not yet configured the web server. Create the www directory with: mkdir -p /var/www Next, cd to the new /var/www directory with: cd /var/www SeAT Download \u00b6 With all of the prerequisites installed as well as our www directory ready we can finally download SeAT. Do that with: composer create-project eveseat/seat --no-dev Once the download is done, you should have seen output such as: Writing lock file Generating optimized autoload files > Illuminate \\F oundation \\C omposerScripts::postAutoloadDump > @php artisan package:discover Discovered Package: darkaonline/l5-swagger Discovered Package: eveseat/api Discovered Package: eveseat/console Discovered Package: eveseat/eveapi Discovered Package: eveseat/notifications Discovered Package: eveseat/services Discovered Package: eveseat/web Package manifest generated successfully. > @php artisan key:generate Application key [ base64:CmhqYNkaIcHo8nYC8LiEWa3U5/+BiTLih5dZftxlV2k =] set successfully. Permissions \u00b6 You may have noticed a warning about composer running as root . For now this can be safely ignored. Post the installation of the SeAT source code, we need to fix up the permissions of the downloaded files. Do that with: chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/seat chmod -R guo+w /var/www/seat/storage/ This will ensure that the web server, cron jobs and workers have access to the source code as well as logs. SELinux \u00b6 Many people hate SELinux, primarily due to a misunderstanding of what it does and how it works. SeAT will run perfectly fine with SELinux enabled, and I actually encourage you to leave it enabled. There is however one small settings change required to make everything work as expected. First, we have to allow web servers to make network connections. This is so that we may connect to ESI, as well as the MariaDB database and Redis. We also have to allow nginx to write to disk. So, configure this with: setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1 setsebool -P httpd_unified 1 Next, we have to ensure that the files and folders in /var/www/seat is correctly labelled in order to prevent SELinux from blocking perfectly normal behaviour. Do this with: restorecon -Rv /var/www/seat That is really it. Pretty painless eh? SeAT Setup \u00b6 With SeAT downloaded, we need to configure it. There are a number of configuration tasks needed. These include editing the applications .env file as well as running some commands that setup and seed the database. A configuration value reference can be found here . .env setup \u00b6 The first task would be to configure the applications database connection. Open the file located at /var/www/seat/.env with something like vi or nano and update the database options with your values. Typically, only the password would really need to be updated. If you are making use of an existing database somewhere else over the network, update the applicable fields such as DB_HOST accordingly. DB_CONNECTION=mysql DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 DB_PORT=3306 DB_DATABASE=seat DB_USERNAME=seat DB_PASSWORD=s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd # <-- this is the value you probably need to edit. DB_DEBUG=false Database Migrations and Seeds \u00b6 Next we need to publish the database migrations and web assets (such as JavaScript scripts and CSS Style sheets), run those migrations and finally seed the SeAT job schedule. Publish the assets and database migrations with: sudo -H -u nginx bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan vendor:publish --force --all' Run the database migrations with: sudo -H -u nginx bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan migrate' Seed the SeAT schedule with: sudo -H -u nginx bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Services\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\ScheduleSeeder' EVE Sde Update \u00b6 SeAT makes use of a number of tables from the EVE Static Data Exports . MySQL conversions of this data is available at https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/ and used in SeAT. To update to the latest SDE within SeAT, run: sudo -H -u nginx bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan eve:update:sde' Supervisor \u00b6 The jobs ecosystem within SeAT requires a process supervisor to ensure that the job runner stays alive. The job runner itself is implemented using Laravel Horizon and is monitored using supervisord . To configure the Horizon process monitor, first install supervisor : yum install -y supervisor Next, we will create a dedicated configuration file which will ask supervisor to keep an eye on Horizon. This file will live in /etc/supervisord.d/seat.ini . Create this file with its recommended configuration with: cat > /etc/supervisord.d/seat.ini << EOL [program:seat] command=/usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan horizon process_name = %(program_name)s-80%(process_num)02d stdout_logfile = /var/log/seat-80%(process_num)02d.log stdout_logfile_maxbytes=100MB stdout_logfile_backups=10 numprocs=1 directory=/var/www/seat stopwaitsecs=600 user=nginx EOL Finally, start supervisord and make sure it will auto start next time the server boots up with: systemctl enable supervisord && systemctl restart supervisord Crontab \u00b6 A crontab entry is needed for SeAT. While simple in implementation, this crontab entry simply helps the application invoke a job checker very minute. The actual schedule is stored within SeAT itself and managed entirely via the Web Interface. To configure the crontab entry required for SeAT, run the following commands: echo '* * * * * php /var/www/seat/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1' > /tmp/seat-crontab.tmp Next, add this crontab for the nginx user with: crontab -u nginx /tmp/seat-crontab.tmp If you want to confirm that the crontab successfully installed, you can check it with crontab -u nginx -l . Web Server \u00b6 Almost there! You almost made it to the end! Just one more step. The SeAT web interface requires a web server to serve the HTML goodies it has. We highly recommend you to use nginx and will be covered in this document. You don't have to use it, so if you prefer something else, feel free. Nginx Install \u00b6 Together with an nginx installation we also need to install php-fpm to handle the PHP execution for us. Let's install nginx and php-fpm with: yum install -y nginx php-fpm Nginx Configuration \u00b6 With the webserver installed, we need to configure nginx to serve SeAT. For that, a configuration file needs to be created that will tell nginx where to find php-fpm as well as where the assets are for SeAT. The configuration file will live at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf . It can be created with the following command: cat > /etc/nginx/nginx.conf << EOL # For more information on configuration, see: # * Official English Documentation: http://nginx.org/en/docs/ # * Official Russian Documentation: http://nginx.org/ru/docs/ user nginx; worker_processes auto; error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log; pid /run/nginx.pid; # Load dynamic modules.

Using the admin user, you will probably and most typically just add your main character to the Superuser group and never login as an admin again. To login as an administrator, simply run the following command : sudo -H -u nginx bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan seat:admin:login' You'll get a link after the command has finished running which looks similar to the one bellow: [ root@localhost nginx ] # sudo - H - u nginx bash - c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan seat:admin:login' SeAT Admin Login URL Generator User 'admin' does not exist . It will be created . Searching for the 'Superuser' role Creating the Superuser role Checking if the Superuser role has the superuser permission Adding the superuser permission to the role Checking if 'admin' is a super user Adding 'admin' to the Superuser role Generating authentication token Your authentication URL is valid for 60 seconds . http : // localhost / auth / login / admin / 9 G3sb8hjMvrbIJrIf10KKtIj1c8e9mL5 Copy it and paste it inside your browser and you will be authenticated as the admin user. Warning If you have not configured the APP_URL setting in the .env file, then the admin url will be generated for localhost . This is most likely incorrect and you can simply replace localhost with your IP address or domain name.

Everything it learns is stored here, along with things such as user accounts for your users. It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required. This document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements. Lets install the database server: yum install mariadb-server With the database server installed, lets start it and configure it to automatically start up the next time our server boots up: systemctl enable mariadb.service && systemctl start mariadb.service Next, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a root password. Note The database root password should not be confused with the operating systems root passwords. They are both completely different. They should also share be the same password. To secure the database, run: mysql_secure_installation This will ask you a series of questions where you should generally just answer yes to. An example run is shown below: [ ... ] Enter current password for root ( enter for none ) : BY DEFAULT IT IS NONE, PRESS ENTER OK, successfully used password, moving on... [ ... ] Set root password? [ Y/n ] y New password: SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE Re-enter new password: SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE Password updated successfully! Reloading privilege tables.. ... Success! [ ... ] Remove anonymous users? [ Y/n ] y ... Success! [ ... ] Disallow root login remotely? [ Y/n ] y ... Success! [ ... ] Remove test database and access to it? [ Y/n ] y [ ... ] Reload privilege tables now? [ Y/n ] y ... Success! [ ... ] That concludes the installation of the database server and securing it. Next, we need to create an actual user and database for SeAT to use on the newly installed server. To do this we use the mysql command line client and enter a few commands as the root user to create the database and the user that will be accessing the server. Let get to it. Fire up the mysql client as root by running: mysql -uroot -p This will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the root account when we ran mysql_secure_installation . This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :) If the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below: root@ubuntu:~# mysql -uroot -p Enter password: Welcome to the MariaDB monitor. Commands end with ; or \\g . Your MariaDB connection id is 16 Copyright ( c ) 2000 , 2018 , Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others. Type 'help;' or '\\h' for help. Type '\\c' to clear the current input statement. MariaDB [( none )] > Create a new database for SeAT to use with: create database seat ; The output should be similar to the below: MariaDB [( none )] > create database seat ; Query OK, 1 row affected ( 0 .00 sec ) Next, we need to create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the new seat database: GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ; Of course, you need to replace s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd with your own unique and strong password. Successfully running this should present you with output similar to the below: MariaDB [( none )] > GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ; Query OK, 0 rows affected ( 0 .00 sec ) In the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as seat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat .

The configuration of this step is covered in a later stage of the documentation. OS Installation \u00b6 Operating System \u00b6 Before we get to installing SeAT, lets ensure that your operating system is up to date. We can do that with basics : apt-get update to refresh the repositories cache. apt-get full-upgrade to update any installed packages. reboot in order to ensure any updated software is the current running version. apt-get autoremove (after the reboot) to cleanup any unneeded packages. Database \u00b6 SeAT relies heavily on a database to function. Everything it learns is stored here, along with things such as user accounts for your users. It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required. This document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements. We need to ensure that we have the latest MariaDB installed. To help with this, MariaDB provides an official repository to get the latest versions. Before we can configure the repository though, we need to install come tools. Do that with: apt-get install curl dirmngr apt-transport-https Next, lets add the MariaDB repository with: curl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup | bash With the repository now setup, lets install the database server: Warning During the installation, you may be asked to set a password for the root MariaDB user account. Make sure you set a long, strong password and remember it. It will be needed for the next step. apt-get install mariadb-server Next, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a root password (if you have not been prompted for it yet). Note The database root password should not be confused with the operating systems root passwords. They are both completely different. They should also share be the same password. To secure the database, run: mysql_secure_installation This will ask you a series of questions, below is how these should be answered: [ ... ] Enter current password for root ( enter for none ) : IF ONE WAS SET, IGNORE THIS OK, successfully used password, moving on... [ ... ] Set root password? [ Y/n ] y New password: SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE Re-enter new password: SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE Password updated successfully! Reloading privilege tables.. ... Success! [ ... ] Remove anonymous users? [ Y/n ] y ... Success! [ ... ] Disallow root login remotely? [ Y/n ] y ... Success! [ ... ] Remove test database and access to it? [ Y/n ] y [ ... ] Reload privilege tables now? [ Y/n ] y ... Success! [ ... ] That concludes the installation of the database server and securing it. Next, we need to create an actual user and database for SeAT to use on the newly installed server. To do this we use the mysql command line client and enter a few commands as the root user to create the database and the user that will be accessing the server. Let get to it. Fire up the mysql client as root by running: mysql -uroot -p This will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the root account when we ran mysql_secure_installation . This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :) If the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below: root@ubuntu:~# mysql -uroot -p Enter password: Welcome to the MariaDB monitor. Commands end with ; or \\g . Your MariaDB connection id is 16 Copyright ( c ) 2000 , 2018 , Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others. Type 'help;' or '\\h' for help. Type '\\c' to clear the current input statement. MariaDB [( none )] > Create a new database for SeAT to use with: create database seat ; The output should be similar to the below: MariaDB [( none )] > create database seat ; Query OK, 1 row affected ( 0 .00 sec ) Next, we need to create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the new seat database: GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ; Of course, you need to replace s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd with your own unique and strong password. Successfully running this should present you with output similar to the below: MariaDB [( none )] > GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ; Query OK, 0 rows affected ( 0 .00 sec ) In the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as seat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat . Finally, we will flush the database server privileges: FLUSH PRIVILEGES ; That concludes the database server setup. You can exit the prompt with exit ; Note Remember the password for the seat database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT. PHP \u00b6 Since SeAT is written primarily in PHP, we will need to install PHP packages. Debian based systems can make use of Sury DPA which is a very popular repository used for specific PHP versions. Depending on the version of Debian you are using, a release specific repository URL should be used for the repository. Select the tab applicable to your Debian version and run the commands within. Stretch 9 Jessie 8 echo \"deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ stretch main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list echo \"deb-src https://packages.sury.org/php/ stretch main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list echo \"deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ jessie main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list echo \"deb-src https://packages.sury.org/php/ jessie main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list Next, we will have to download the repository GPG signing key and add it into our keychain apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com AC0E47584A7A714D With the new repository configured, update the package lists with: apt-get update Finally, install the required PHP packages with: apt-get install curl zip php7.2-cli php7.2-mysql php7.2-intl php7.2-curl php7.2-gd php7.2-mbstring php7.2-bz2 php7.2-dom php7.2-zip Redis \u00b6 SeAT makes use of Redis as a cache and message broker for the Queue back end. Installing it is really easy. Do it with: apt-get install redis-server SeAT Installation \u00b6 Prerequisites \u00b6 Excellent progress! All of the operating system level requirements are now met and we are almost ready to install SeAT itself. The only thing that is outstanding is the package manager called composer as well as the git client. The combination of composer and git will let us download the SeAT source code from Github and install it locally. Git \u00b6 Install git with: apt-get install git Composer \u00b6 Next, install composer with: curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir = /usr/local/bin --filename = composer && hash -r Thats it. Lets install SeAT! By default, we suggest you run SeAT from within /var/www/seat . As part of the installation, the seat directory will be created for us, but we will need to create /var/www for now as we have not yet configured the web server. Create the www directory with: mkdir -p /var/www Next, cd to the new /var/www directory with: cd /var/www SeAT Download \u00b6 With all of the prerequisites installed as well as our www directory ready we can finally download SeAT. Do that with: composer create-project eveseat/seat --no-dev Once the download is done, you should have seen output such as: Writing lock file Generating optimized autoload files > Illuminate \\F oundation \\C omposerScripts::postAutoloadDump > @php artisan package:discover Discovered Package: darkaonline/l5-swagger Discovered Package: eveseat/api Discovered Package: eveseat/console Discovered Package: eveseat/eveapi Discovered Package: eveseat/notifications Discovered Package: eveseat/services Discovered Package: eveseat/web Package manifest generated successfully. > @php artisan key:generate Application key [ base64:CmhqYNkaIcHo8nYC8LiEWa3U5/+BiTLih5dZftxlV2k =] set successfully. Permissions \u00b6 You may have noticed a warning about composer running as root . For now this can be safely ignored. Post the installation of the SeAT source code, we need to fix up the permissions of the downloaded files. Do that with: chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/seat chmod -R guo+w /var/www/seat/storage/ This will ensure that the web server, cron jobs and workers have access to the source code as well as logs. Additionally, when commands are run to interact with SeAT, in order to ensure that the permissions stay intact, sudo will be needed to run commands as the www-data user. Lets install sudo now: apt-get install sudo SeAT Setup \u00b6 With SeAT downloaded, we need to configure it. There are a number of configuration tasks needed. These include editing the applications .env file as well as running some commands that setup and seed the database. A configuration value reference can be found here . .env setup \u00b6 The first task would be to configure the applications database connection. Open the file located at /var/www/seat/.env with something like vi or nano and update the database options with your values. Typically, only the password would really need to be updated. If you are making use of an existing database somewhere else over the network, update the applicable fields such as DB_HOST accordingly. DB_CONNECTION=mysql DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 DB_PORT=3306 DB_DATABASE=seat DB_USERNAME=seat DB_PASSWORD=s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd # <-- this is the value you probably need to edit. DB_DEBUG=false Database Migrations and Seeds \u00b6 Next we need to publish the database migrations and web assets (such as JavaScript scripts and CSS Style sheets), run those migrations and finally seed the SeAT job schedule. Publish the assets and database migrations with: sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan vendor:publish --force --all' Run the database migrations with: sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan migrate' Seed the SeAT schedule with: sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Services\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\ScheduleSeeder' EVE SDE Update \u00b6 SeAT makes use of a number of tables from the EVE Static Data Exports . MySQL conversions of this data is available at https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/ and used in SeAT. To update to the latest SDE within SeAT, run: sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan eve:update:sde' Supervisor \u00b6 The jobs ecosystem within SeAT requires a process supervisor to ensure that the job runner stays alive. The job runner itself is implemented using Laravel Horizon and is monitored using supervisord . To configure the Horizon process monitor, first install supervisor : apt-get install supervisor Next, we will create a dedicated configuration file which will ask supervisor to keep an eye on Horizon. This file will live in /etc/supervisor/conf.d/seat.conf . Create this file with its recommended configuration with: cat > /etc/supervisor/conf.d/seat.conf << EOL [program:seat] command=/usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan horizon process_name = %(program_name)s-80%(process_num)02d stdout_logfile = /var/log/seat-80%(process_num)02d.log stdout_logfile_maxbytes=100MB stdout_logfile_backups=10 numprocs=1 directory=/var/www/seat stopwaitsecs=600 user=www-data EOL Finally, reload supervisor to apply the new configuration with the following command: systemctl restart supervisor.service Crontab \u00b6 A crontab entry is needed for SeAT. While simple in implementation, this crontab entry simply helps the application invoke a job checker very minute. The actual schedule is stored within SeAT itself and managed entirely via the Web Interface. To configure the crontab entry required for SeAT, run the following commands: echo '* * * * * php /var/www/seat/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1' > /tmp/seat-crontab.tmp Next, add this crontab for the www-data user with: crontab -u www-data /tmp/seat-crontab.tmp If you want to confirm that the crontab successfully installed, you can check it with crontab -u www-data -l . Web Server \u00b6 Almost there! You almost made it to the end! Just one more step. The SeAT web interface requires a web server to serve the HTML goodies it has. We highly recommend you to use nginx and will be covered in this document. You don't have to use it, so if you prefer something else, feel free. Nginx Install \u00b6 Together with an nginx installation we also need to install php-fpm to handle the PHP execution for us. Let's install nginx and php-fpm with: apt-get install nginx php7.2-fpm Nginx Configuration \u00b6 With the webserver installed, we need to configure nginx to serve SeAT. For that, a configuration file needs to be created that will tell nginx where to find php-fpm as well as where the assets are for SeAT. The configuration file will live at /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat . It can be created with the following command: cat > /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat << EOL server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; # If you are hosting this instance on a domain, set that # name here. #server_name seat.yourdomain.com; # SeAT public directory. This is the only directory that # should be exposed by the webserver. If one has to expose # the parent directory then things like the .env file will # be available for anyone to download. root /var/www/seat/public; index index.php; location / { try_files \\$uri \\$uri/ /index.php?\\$query_string; } # PHP-FPM configuration. location ~ \\.php\\$ { try_files \\$uri /index.php =404; fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock; fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME \\$document_root\\$fastcgi_script_name; include fastcgi_params; } # Even though .htaccess rules mean nothing in the nginx # world, prevent those from being downloaded anyways. location ~ /\\.ht { deny all; } # In case someone messes up, prevent .env files from # being downloaded as well. location ~ /\\.env { deny all; } } EOL The configuration file as is at /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat itself won't be loaded by nginx yet. Storing configuration files in a *sites-available* directory is simply a convention used to allow administrators to quickly add & remove sites if needed. To apply the changes made by the new configuration file it needs to be symlinked to a *sites-enabled* directory. Let's symlink to the new configuration and drop the default one as a hardening exercise at the same time: ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/seat rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default Finally, reload nginx and php-fpm for the new changes to take affect: systemctl restart nginx.service systemctl restart php7.2-fpm.service Admin Login \u00b6 Since SeAT 3.0, an admin user is a special user and can no longer link characters or corporations to it. Using the admin user, you will probably and most typically just add your main character to the Superuser group and never login as an admin again. To login as an administrator, simply run the following command : sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan seat:admin:login' You'll get a link after the command has finished running which looks similar to the one bellow: root @ubuntu : / var / www / seat # sudo - H - u www - data bash - c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan seat:admin:login' SeAT Admin Login URL Generator User 'admin' does not exist . It will be created . Searching for the 'Superuser' role Creating the Superuser role Checking if the Superuser role has the superuser permission Adding the superuser permission to the role Checking if 'admin' is a super user Adding 'admin' to the Superuser role Generating authentication token Your authentication URL is valid for 60 seconds . http : // localhost / auth / login / admin / 9 G3sb8hjMvrbIJrIf10KKtIj1c8e9mL5 Copy it and paste it inside your browser and you will be authenticated as the admin user. Warning If you have not configured the APP_URL setting in the .env file, then the admin url will be generated for localhost . This is most likely incorrect and you can simply replace localhost with your IP address or domain name. ESI Configuration \u00b6 As mentioned at the start of the guide, it is necessary for you to configure ESI. For instructions now how to do this, please refer to the ESI Setup Guide .

It can be created with the following command: cat > /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat << EOL server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; # If you are hosting this instance on a domain, set that # name here. #server_name seat.yourdomain.com; # SeAT public directory.

A small amount of Linux experience is preferred when it comes to this guide, although it is not entirely mandatory. Getting started \u00b6 We are going to assume you have root access to a fresh Ubuntu Server. Typically access is gained via SSH. All of the below commands are to be entered in the SSH terminal session for the installation & configuration of SeAT. If the server you want to install SeAT on is being used for other things too (such as hosting MySQL databases and or websites), then please keep that in mind while following this guide. Packages are installed using the aptitude package manager as the root user. Eve Application and ESI SeAT 3.0 consumes CCP's ESI service in order to retrieve EVE Online related information. Before you can make any authenticated calls to ESI, you have to register a third party EVE application on the developers portal. This is an absolute must for SeAT to be of any use. The configuration of this step is covered in a later stage of the documentation. OS Installation \u00b6 Operating System \u00b6 Before we get to installing SeAT, lets ensure that your operating system is up to date. We can do that with basics : apt-get update to refresh the repositories cache. apt-get full-upgrade to update any installed packages. reboot in order to ensure any updated software is the current running version. apt-get autoremove (after the reboot) to cleanup any unneeded packages. Database \u00b6 SeAT relies heavily on a database to function. Everything it learns is stored here, along with things such as user accounts for your users. It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required. This document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements. We need to ensure that we have the latest MariaDB installed. To help with this, MariaDB provides an official repository to get the latest versions. Lets add this repository with: curl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup | bash With the repository now setup, lets install the database server: Warning During the installation, you may be asked to set a password for the root MariaDB user account. Make sure you set a long, strong password and remember it. It will be needed for the next step. apt-get install mariadb-server Next, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a root password (if you have not been prompted for it yet). Note The database root password should not be confused with the operating systems root passwords. They are both completely different. They should also share be the same password. To secure the database, run: mysql_secure_installation This will ask you a series of questions where you should generally just answer yes to. If you already set a root password in the previous step then you dont have to set it again, otherwise, make sure you choose a long, strong password for the root account. An example run is shown below: [ ... ] Enter current password for root ( enter for none ) : IF ONE WAS SET, IGNORE THIS OK, successfully used password, moving on... [ ... ] Set root password? [ Y/n ] y New password: SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE Re-enter new password: SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE Password updated successfully! Reloading privilege tables.. ... Success! [ ... ] Remove anonymous users? [ Y/n ] y ... Success! [ ... ] Disallow root login remotely? [ Y/n ] y ... Success! [ ... ] Remove test database and access to it? [ Y/n ] y [ ... ] Reload privilege tables now? [ Y/n ] y ... Success! [ ... ] That concludes the installation of the database server and securing it. Next, we need to create an actual user and database for SeAT to use on the newly installed server. To do this we use the mysql command line client and enter a few commands as the root user to create the database and the user that will be accessing the server. Let get to it. Fire up the mysql client as root by running: mysql -uroot -p This will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the root account when we ran mysql_secure_installation . This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :) If the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below: root@ubuntu:~# mysql -uroot -p Enter password: Welcome to the MariaDB monitor. Commands end with ; or \\g . Your MariaDB connection id is 16 Copyright ( c ) 2000 , 2018 , Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others. Type 'help;' or '\\h' for help. Type '\\c' to clear the current input statement. MariaDB [( none )] > Create a new database for SeAT to use with: create database seat ; The output should be similar to the below: MariaDB [( none )] > create database seat ; Query OK, 1 row affected ( 0 .00 sec ) Next, we need to create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the new seat database: GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ; Of course, you need to replace s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd with your own unique and strong password. Successfully running this should present you with output similar to the below: MariaDB [( none )] > GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ; Query OK, 0 rows affected ( 0 .00 sec ) In the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as seat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat . Finally, we will flush the database server privileges: FLUSH PRIVILEGES ; That concludes the database server setup. You can exit the prompt with exit ; Note Remember the password for the seat database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT. PHP \u00b6 Since SeAT is written primarily in PHP, we will need to install PHP packages. Ubuntu based systems can make use of the ondrej PPA which is a very popular repository used for specific PHP versions. Depending on the version of Ubuntu you are using, a release specific repository URL should be used for the PPA. Select the tab applicable to your Ubuntu version and run the commands within. Xenial 16.04 Artful 17.10 Bionic 18.04 echo \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu xenial main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list echo \"deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu xenial main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list echo \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu artful main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list echo \"deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu artful main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list echo \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu bionic main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list echo \"deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu bionic main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list Next, we will have to download the new repositories GPG signing key and add it into our keychain apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 4F4EA0AAE5267A6C With the new repository configured, update the package lists with: apt-get update Finally, install the required PHP packages with: apt-get install curl zip php7.1-cli php7.1-mysql php7.1-mcrypt php7.1-intl php7.1-curl php7.1-gd php7.1-mbstring php7.1-bz2 php7.1-dom php7.1-zip Redis \u00b6 SeAT makes use of Redis as a cache and message broker for the Queue back end. Installing it is really easy. Do it with: apt-get install redis-server SeAT Installation \u00b6 Prerequisites \u00b6 Excellent progress! All of the operating system level requirements are now met and we are almost ready to install SeAT itself. The only thing that is outstanding is the package manager called composer as well as the git client. The combination of composer and git will let us download the SeAT source code from Github and install it locally. Git \u00b6 Install git with: apt-get install git Composer \u00b6 Next, install composer with: curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir = /usr/local/bin --filename = composer && hash -r Thats it. Lets install SeAT! By default, we suggest you run SeAT from within /var/www/seat . As part of the installation, the seat directory will be created for us, but we will need to create /var/www for now as we have not yet configured the web server. Create the www directory with: mkdir -p /var/www Next, cd to the new /var/www directory with: cd /var/www SeAT Download \u00b6 With all of the prerequisites installed as well as our www directory ready we can finally download SeAT. Do that with: composer create-project eveseat/seat --no-dev Once the download is done, you should have seen output such as: Writing lock file Generating optimized autoload files > Illuminate \\F oundation \\C omposerScripts::postAutoloadDump > @php artisan package:discover Discovered Package: darkaonline/l5-swagger Discovered Package: eveseat/api Discovered Package: eveseat/console Discovered Package: eveseat/eveapi Discovered Package: eveseat/notifications Discovered Package: eveseat/services Discovered Package: eveseat/web Package manifest generated successfully. > @php artisan key:generate Application key [ base64:CmhqYNkaIcHo8nYC8LiEWa3U5/+BiTLih5dZftxlV2k =] set successfully. Permissions \u00b6 You may have noticed a warning about composer running as root . For now this can be safely ignored. Post the installation of the SeAT source code, we need to fix up the permissions of the downloaded files. Do that with: chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/seat chmod -R guo+w /var/www/seat/storage/ This will ensure that the web server, cron jobs and workers have access to the source code as well as logs. SeAT Setup \u00b6 With SeAT downloaded, we need to configure it. There are a number of configuration tasks needed. These include editing the applications .env file as well as running some commands that setup and seed the database. A configuration value reference can be found here . .env setup \u00b6 The first task would be to configure the applications database connection. Open the file located at /var/www/seat/.env with something like vi or nano and update the database options with your values. Typically, only the password would really need to be updated. If you are making use of an existing database somewhere else over the network, update the applicable fields such as DB_HOST accordingly. DB_CONNECTION=mysql DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 DB_PORT=3306 DB_DATABASE=seat DB_USERNAME=seat DB_PASSWORD=s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd # <-- this is the value you probably need to edit. DB_DEBUG=false Database Migrations and Seeds \u00b6 Next we need to publish the database migrations and web assets (such as JavaScript scripts and CSS Style sheets), run those migrations and finally seed the SeAT job schedule. Publish the assets and database migrations with: sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan vendor:publish --force --all' Run the database migrations with: sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan migrate' Seed the SeAT schedule with: sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Services\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\ScheduleSeeder' EVE Sde Update \u00b6 SeAT makes use of a number of tables from the EVE Static Data Exports . MySQL conversions of this data is available at https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/ and used in SeAT. To update to the latest SDE within SeAT, run: sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan eve:update:sde' Supervisor \u00b6 The jobs ecosystem within SeAT requires a process supervisor to ensure that the job runner stays alive. The job runner itself is implemented using Laravel Horizon and is monitored using supervisord . To configure the Horizon process monitor, first install supervisor : apt-get install supervisor Next, we will create a dedicated configuration file which will ask supervisor to keep an eye on Horizon. This file will live in /etc/supervisor/conf.d/seat.conf . Create this file with its recommended configuration with: cat > /etc/supervisor/conf.d/seat.conf << EOL [program:seat] command=/usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan horizon process_name = %(program_name)s-80%(process_num)02d stdout_logfile = /var/log/seat-80%(process_num)02d.log stdout_logfile_maxbytes=100MB stdout_logfile_backups=10 numprocs=1 directory=/var/www/seat stopwaitsecs=600 user=www-data EOL Finally, reload supervisor to apply the new configuration with the following command: systemctl restart supervisor.service Crontab \u00b6 A crontab entry is needed for SeAT. While simple in implementation, this crontab entry simply helps the application invoke a job checker very minute. The actual schedule is stored within SeAT itself and managed entirely via the Web Interface. To configure the crontab entry required for SeAT, run the following commands: echo '* * * * * php /var/www/seat/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1' > /tmp/seat-crontab.tmp Next, add this crontab for the www-data user with: crontab -u www-data /tmp/seat-crontab.tmp If you want to confirm that the crontab successfully installed, you can check it with crontab -u www-data -l . Web Server \u00b6 Almost there! You almost made it to the end! Just one more step. The SeAT web interface requires a web server to serve the HTML goodies it has. We highly recommend you to use nginx and will be covered in this document. You don't have to use it, so if you prefer something else, feel free. Nginx Install \u00b6 Together with an nginx installation we also need to install php-fpm to handle the PHP execution for us. Let's install nginx and php-fpm with: apt-get install nginx php7.1-fpm Nginx Configuration \u00b6 With the webserver installed, we need to configure nginx to serve SeAT. For that, a configuration file needs to be created that will tell nginx where to find php-fpm as well as where the assets are for SeAT. The configuration file will live at /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat . It can be created with the following command: cat > /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat << EOL server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; # If you are hosting this instance on a domain, set that # name here. #server_name seat.yourdomain.com; # SeAT public directory. This is the only directory that # should be exposed by the webserver. If one has to expose # the parent directory then things like the .env file will # be available for anyone to download. root /var/www/seat/public; index index.php; location / { try_files \\$uri \\$uri/ /index.php?\\$query_string; } # PHP-FPM configuration. location ~ \\.php\\$ { try_files \\$uri /index.php =404; fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.1-fpm.sock; fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME \\$document_root\\$fastcgi_script_name; include fastcgi_params; } # Even though .htaccess rules mean nothing in the nginx # world, prevent those from being downloaded anyways. location ~ /\\.ht { deny all; } # In case someone messes up, prevent .env files from # being downloaded as well. location ~ /\\.env { deny all; } } EOL The configuration file as is at /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat itself won't be loaded by nginx yet. Storing configuration files in a *sites-available* directory is simply a convention used to allow administrators to quickly add & remove sites if needed. To apply the changes made by the new configuration file it needs to be symlinked to a *sites-enabled* directory. Let's symlink to the new configuration and drop the default one as a hardening exercise at the same time: ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/seat rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default Finally, reload nginx and php-fpm for the new changes to take affect: systemctl restart nginx.service systemctl restart php7.1-fpm.service Admin Login \u00b6 Since SeAT 3.0, an admin user is a special user and can no longer link characters or corporations to it. Using the admin user, you will probably and most typically just add your main character to the Superuser group and never login as an admin again. To login as an administrator, simply run the following command : sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan seat:admin:login' You'll get a link after the command has finished running which looks similar to the one bellow: root @ubuntu : / var / www / seat # sudo - H - u www - data bash - c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan seat:admin:login' SeAT Admin Login URL Generator User 'admin' does not exist .

Tr\u00e6fik \u00b6 Tr\u00e6fik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy. Most of the time SeAT is not going to be the only web application running on your Webserver. Therefore you need an orchestrator or proxy-server which handles sub-domains, ports, certificates etc. Here Tr\u00e6fik makes managing your webserver very easy, especially because it is docker aware and configures itself. Let's encrypt by default This guide will automatically enable HTTPS via Let's encrypt (Free SSL-Certificates \\o/). Installation \u00b6 First create a new docker network: docker network create web Next, we need to create a directory on the server where we will store the Tr\u00e6fik configuration files.

This is mainly due to the number of fundamental changes that were made in the SeAT 2.x release. Notes on the upgrade \u00b6 The way SeAT is structured has not changed much since its version 1x days. The biggest change is a Laravel framework upgrade to version 5.3. This introduced a new base layout for the application which is why the manual upgrade is needed. The upgrade process has a large amount of database migrations that need to run so grab a coffee depending on how big your database is! Requirements \u00b6 SeAT 2.0 requires PHP 7.0. At the time of writing this document, PHP 7.1 is not supported due to bug in PhealNG (the component SeAT uses to talk to the EVE API). MySQL 5.7 is recommended but not required. A database backup is an absolute must . Everything in SeAT can be recovered is some way or form except for your database . Make 100% sure you backed this up before proceeding with the upgrade! Take note of where SeAT is installed. This is usually in /var/www/seat . Upgrade procedure \u00b6 Preparation \u00b6 If users are using your SeAT instance, or the workers are churning away in the background, then you may risk losing some information (although unlikely). Its therefore recommended that you start by putting SeAT into maintenance mode before starting the upgrade. Do this by running the following command in your SeAT path. $ cd /var/www/seat $ php artisan down You should see the message Application is now in maintenance mode. . Backups \u00b6 Make a backup of your SeAT database and store it somewhere safe! Do not skip this step! In your SeAT directory, make a copy of the .env file. This file contains all of your SeAT configuration. These values are needed to reconnect to the database once SeAT 2.0 is installed. Php 7 \u00b6 Install PHP7 if you don't have it already. You can check your PHP version by running php -v : $ php -v PHP 7 .0.14 ( cli ) ( built: Dec 7 2016 10 :25:25 ) ( NTS ) Copyright ( c ) 1997 -2016 The PHP Group Zend Engine v3.0.0, Copyright ( c ) 1998 -2016 Zend Technologies Get the new code \u00b6 SeAT 2.0 can be installed in exactly the same place as where you had your v1.x installation. If you reuse this path then no webserver re-configuration will be needed. We will move the old installation out of the way, and install SeAT 2.0. To do this, run the following commands: First, move the old installation out of the way: $ cd /var/www $ mv seat seat.old You can double check that this was successful by running ls and ensuring that there is a folder named seat.old now. Next, get the new SeAT code by running composer create-project eveseat/seat seat --no-dev : $ cd /var/www $ composer create-project eveseat/seat seat --no-dev Installing eveseat/seat ( 2 .0.0 ) - Installing eveseat/seat ( 2 .0.0 ) Loading from cache Created project in seat > php -r \"file_exists('.env') || copy('.env.example', '.env');\" Loading composer repositories with package information Updating dependencies [ ... snip ... ] Publish the assets \u00b6 Next, we need to publish the new SeAT 2.0 CSS & Javascript and database migrations. This can be done with php artisan vendor:publish --force . Reconfigure .env file \u00b6 With the new code ready to use, the next thing that is required is to reconnect the database. Remember that .env file you backed up earlier? Refer to it for the values needed in the newly installed env file that can be found at /var/www/seat/.env . Important keys to populate with the correct values are: DB_HOST = DB_PORT = DB_DATABASE = DB_USERNAME = DB_PASSWORD = SeAT 2.0 introduced new configuration items in the .env that you can review. There is also the option to configure Supervisor & SeAT integration, which can be done by following the admin guide titled SeAT & Supervisor Integration . Run migrations \u00b6 With the database reconnected, its time to run the migrations for SeAT 2.0. This is the part that may take some time, depending on how big your database is. To run the migrations, make sure you are still in your seat path ( /var/www/seat ) and run php artisan migrate : $ cd /var/www/seat $ php artisan migrate You will see a bunch of messages and eventually your shell prompt again, indicating that it has completed. If you receive errors here, double check that you have entered the correct database settings in the .env file previously mentioned. Database seeders \u00b6 With the database migration complete, its time to seed it with some of the static data SeAT needs. Do this with the following commands: php artisan db:seed --class = Seat \\\\ Notifications \\\\ database \\\\ seeds \\\\ ScheduleSeeder php artisan db:seed --class = Seat \\\\ Services \\\\ database \\\\ seeds \\\\ NotificationTypesSeeder php artisan db:seed --class = Seat \\\\ Services \\\\ database \\\\ seeds \\\\ ScheduleSeeder Update worker jobs \u00b6 The Laravel 5.3 upgrade in SeAT changed the way worker jobs are started. You can edit the command used to start a worker in your seat.conf file in supervisor. Normally, this file will be somewhere like in /etc/supervisor/conf.d/ .

The process described bellow handles data conversion between the SeAT 2.x structure and SeAT 3.x one. Requirements \u00b6 Check SeAT 3.0 Requirements A database backup is an absolute must . Everything in SeAT can be recovered is some way or form except for your database . Make 100% sure you backed this up before proceeding with the upgrade! Enough storage space to contains SeAT 2, SeAT 3, a backup of SeAT 2 database and a backup of SeAT 3 database. Take note of where SeAT 2 is installed. This is usually in /var/www/seat . Upgrade procedure \u00b6 Preparation \u00b6 If users are using your SeAT instance, or the workers are churning away in the background, then you may risk losing some information (although unlikely). Its therefore recommended that you start by putting SeAT into maintenance mode before starting the upgrade. Do this by running the following command in your SeAT path. php artisan down If you are running this migration after CCP killed the XML API then there is probably no risk of the updaters doing anything useful anyways :D Backups \u00b6 Make a backup of your SeAT database and store it somewhere safe! Do not skip this step! In your SeAT directory, make a copy of the .env file. This file contains all of your SeAT configuration. These values may be useful in case of failure. Installing SeAT 3.0 \u00b6 Rename the current SeAT directory from /var/www/seat to /var/www/seat2 . You don't have to update any config since we will only use the command line for the process. mv /var/www/seat /var/www/seat2 Follow standard installation instructions for SeAT 3.0. Warning You need to keep the current SeAT 2.0 installed in order to migrate data to a newly installed 3.0 instance. It doesn't have to be reachable from internet though since we will only use the command line for the process. Installing the migrator package on SeAT 2.0 \u00b6 Move to your SeAT 2.0 installation directory (should be /var/www/seat2 - unless you changed it) Add the package called seat-migrator using composer require warlof/seat-migrator Edit the app.php file inside the config folder by appending Warlof\\Seat\\Migrator\\MigratorServiceProvider::class, to the end of providers array. Once done, publish the package files using php artisan vendor:publish --force Run migration scripts with php artisan migrate Finally, run php artisan seat:migrator:upgrade and follow the wizard At the end of the process, you will have most of your data transferred into the specified SeAT 3.0 database. Next, you can remove the seat2 directory with rm -R /var/www/seat2 and the old database. Enjoy SeAT 3.0 Note In case of any troubles, the migrator package did a backup before starting the migration process. The output is specified in the prompt while it is being done, but you will also find it in /var/www/seat2/storage/backup .","title":"From SeAT 2.0"},{"location":"upgrading/from_seat_2_0/#seat-20-to-30","text":"The upgrade path from SeAT 2.x to SeAT 3.0 requires some manual work.

This guide applies to any other installation type only. General Upgrades \u00b6 As with anything, it is a very good idea to have backups ready before attempting any upgrades. In the case of SeAT, the most important component that needs to be backed up is the SeAT database. In short, something as simple as mysqldump -uroot -p seat > backup.sql should be perfectly fine. Should something go wrong, then you can simply re-install SeAT, restore the database and you should be good to go. Upgrade Options \u00b6 There are 2 ways to upgrade SeAT. The recommended way being the seat tool and then the manual way when you are not using a docker-based installed. For most cases the seat tool should be fine as it tries to auto detect things for you, however, if you edited the defaults or installed on some custom operating system, then you may need to upgrade manually. Upgrading using the seat tool \u00b6 All you need to do is run the upgrade command and all will be done for you. Follow the next steps to get this done: If you haven't downloaded the seat tool yet, do so now by running: curl -fsSL https://git.io/seat-tool -o /usr/local/bin/seat && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/seat If you already have the seat tool downloaded, make sure the tool itself is at its latest version. Do this by running: seat update:self . If you have not yet backed up your database, do so now! This is the only part that can not be recovered in case something goes wrong! Ensure that the job queue is empty. Upgrade SeAT by running: seat update:seat . Manually upgrading \u00b6 If you cant or don't want to use the SeAT tool, follow these steps to upgrade SeAT. Ensure that you are in the path where you installed. By default this should be /var/www/seat . Put your application into maintenance mode. This will ensure that no request from the outside will hit your applications logic, and also help you perform an upgrade uninterrupted. Do this with: php artisan down Its a good thing to update composer itself. This is not a hard requirement, but definitely recommended. Do this with: composer self-update The next thing to do is get the latest SeAT packages. The below example adds the --no-dev argument as these packages are generally not needed in production. Upgrade the packages with: composer update --no-dev With the packages upgraded, we can now publish any new migrations/assets/configs. This can be done with: php artisan vendor:publish --force --all Once the needed files are published, run any new/outstanding migrations with: php artisan migrate With the migrations done, run the seeders to update any static data: php artisan db:seed --class = Seat \\\\ Services \\\\ database \\\\ seeds \\\\ ScheduleSeeder Restart the supervisor workers to ensure they also pickup the latest code: supervisorctl restart all Finally, we can simply bring our application back out of maintenance mode with: php artisan up","title":"General"},{"location":"upgrading/general/#general-upgrades","text":"As with anything, it is a very good idea to have backups ready before attempting any upgrades.
