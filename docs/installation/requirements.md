# Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

As far as hardware goes, there isn't really a hard and fast rule on what is needed.
The more resources you make available, the faster API updates will occur.
However, there are some minimum *recommended* specifications.

!!! warning

    If you intend to process a large amount of data, plan your storage accordingly.
    The SeAT database can grow incredibly quickly depending on the amount of tokens you process.
    
    Due to high I/O traffic generated by SeAT, we recommand NVMe storage usage for best performances.

### Up to 25 users

| Type                    | Requirement                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| CPU                     | 2 virtual cores                          |

| Database Storage Space  | 5GB (tend to grow with user and history) |

### Up to 50 users

| Type                    | Requirement                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| CPU                     | 4 virtual cores                           |
| Memory                  | 4GB of RAM                                |

### Up to 100 users

| Type                    | Requirement                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

| ESI Cache Storage Space | 10GB (tend to grow with users)            |
| Database Storage Space  | 20GB (tend to grow with user and history) |

### More than 100 users

If you plan to run SeAT for more than 100 users, you will have to fine tune your installation and carefully monitoring it.
At time this documentation is wrote, a standard character is queuing around 50 jobs per wave.
Since all jobs are not doing the same thing, it's difficult to provide you accurate figures.

A single worker is consuming around 200 MB of memory. Most jobs are requiring less than 5% of CPU - however, a few of them need more than 20% of it.
The more jobs you'll get, the more workers you'll need to process queue in less than 60 minutes.

!!! warning

    With such installation, you shouldn't share SeAT server resources with other services.
    Also, you should consider deploying database on another server.

## Software Requirements

### Docker Environment

For Docker based installations, all you need is `docker` and `docker-compose`.
If you already have it installed, check your current version with `docker version` and `docker-compose version` respectively.

| Type           | Requirement                                              | Version Check            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Docker         | [Docker: ^18.0](https://www.docker.com/)                 | `docker -v`              |
| Docker Compose | [Docker compose: ^1.20](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)| `docker-compose version` |

!!! warning

    Do not install Docker directly from your distributions repositories. These are usually out of date.
    Instead, rather follow the steps provided on dockers [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Blade Environment

!!! info

    We consider "blade", any environment on which SeAT has been deployed manually (instead using containers).

Software version requirements are based on a *minimum* requirement.

| Type                       | Requirement   | State Check |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Operating System           | Linux (any distribution is suitable, however, Ubuntu tends to get more up-to-date packages on official repositories). For Windows, you will need [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/). | Usually, running `cat /etc/issue` should give you a good idea. |
| Architecture               | 64-bit only                                                                                                         | `uname -p`               |
| PHP                        | [PHP: ^7.3](http://php.net/) including mysql, gd, bz2, intl, pcntl, gmp, openssl, zip, opcache and redis extensions | `php -v` and `php -i`    |
| Database                   | [MariaDB: ^10.2.7](https://mariadb.org/) or [MySQL: ^5.7](https://www.mysql.com/)                                   | `mysql -V`               |
| Caching Service            | [Redis](https://redis.io/)                                                                                          | `redis-server -v`        |
| Service Supervisor         | [Supervisor : 3](http://supervisord.org/)                                                                           | `supervisord -v`         |
| Web Server                 | [NGinX](https://www.nginx.com/) or [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)                                              | `nginx -v` or `httpd -v` |

!!! tip

    In case you want to deploy SeAT with Apache as web server, plan to configure it with Fast CGI using php-fpm instead embedded php process.
    Doing it so will make you benefit of significant improved performances.
