# Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

As far as hardware goes, there isn't really a hard and fast rule on what is needed.
The more resources you make available, the faster API updates will occur.
However, there are some minimum *recommended* specifications.

!!! info

    Required CPU cores are indicative and may changes depending on your processor.
    They have been based on a one tier deployment (app, workers and database are hosted on the same server).
    
    To improve accuracy regarding CPU requirements, we provide a [Coremark] value.
    Since Cloud providers like [Azure] and [Google Cloud] are providing their instance benchmark using this test, it should give you a more meaningful idea of what we are talking about.

!!! warning

    If you intend to process a large amount of data, plan your storage accordingly.
    The SeAT database can grow incredibly quickly depending on the amount of tokens you process.
    
    Due to high I/O traffic generated by SeAT, we recommand NVMe storage usage for best performances.

| Type                    | Requirement                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |

| Database Storage Space  | 20GB (tend to grow with characters and history) |

### More than 1 000 characters

If you plan to run SeAT for more than 1 000 characters, you will have to fine tune your installation and carefully monitoring it.
At time this documentation is wrote, a standard character is queuing around 50 jobs per wave.
Since all jobs are not doing the same thing, it's difficult to provide you accurate figures.

A single worker is consuming around 200 MB of memory. Most jobs are requiring less than 5% of CPU - however, a few of them need more than 20% of it.
The more jobs you'll get, the more workers you'll need to process queue in less than 60 minutes.

!!! warning

    With such installation, you shouldn't share SeAT server resources with other services.
    Also, you should consider deploying database on another server.

## Software Requirements

### Docker Environment

For Docker based installations, all you need is `docker` and `docker-compose`.
If you already have it installed, check your current version with `docker version` and `docker-compose version` respectively.

| Type           | Requirement                                              | Version Check            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Docker         | [Docker: ^18.0](https://www.docker.com/)                 | `docker -v`              |
| Docker Compose | [Docker compose: ^1.20](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)| `docker-compose version` |

!!! warning

    Do not install Docker directly from your distributions repositories. These are usually out of date.
    Instead, rather follow the steps provided on dockers [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

    When considering a VPS provider, make sure you choose one that does not make use of OpenVZ or similar operating-system level virtualization technologies. These virtualization technologies limit you in terms of kernel access as they purely containerize an existing Linux installation.

    For a successful docker installation, choose a provider that uses para-virtualized technologies such as KVM, VMWare or XEN allowing you full control to the instance (and therefor the kernel itself). Examples of such providers are [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) and [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/).

### Blade Environment

!!! info

    We consider "blade", any environment on which SeAT has been deployed manually (instead using containers).

Software version requirements are based on a *minimum* requirement.

| Type                       | Requirement   | State Check |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Operating System           | Linux (any distribution is suitable, however, Ubuntu tends to get more up-to-date packages on official repositories). For Windows, you will need [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/). | Usually, running `cat /etc/issue` should give you a good idea. |
| Architecture               | 64-bit only                                                                                                         | `uname -p`               |
| PHP                        | [PHP: ^7.3](http://php.net/) including mysql, gd, bz2, intl, pcntl, gmp, openssl, zip, opcache and redis extensions | `php -v` and `php -i`    |
| Database                   | [MariaDB: ^10.2.7](https://mariadb.org/) or [MySQL: ^5.7](https://www.mysql.com/)                                   | `mysql -V`               |
| Caching Service            | [Redis](https://redis.io/)                                                                                          | `redis-server -v`        |
| Service Supervisor         | [Supervisor : 3](http://supervisord.org/)                                                                           | `supervisord -v`         |
| Web Server                 | [NGinX](https://www.nginx.com/) or [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)                                              | `nginx -v` or `httpd -v` |

!!! tip

    In case you want to deploy SeAT with Apache as web server, plan to configure it with Fast CGI using php-fpm instead embedded php process.
    Doing it so will make you benefit of significant improved performances.
