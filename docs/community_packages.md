# Community Packages

Below is a list of packages contributed by the community. These packages normally follow the same installation procedure, however, its best you consult the documentation of the package itself in case there is anything special you need to get it working.

## Generic package installation
Packages will normally come in the form of a composer package that you need to include in your SeAT install, as well as a Service Provider that you need to bootstrap. So, generically speaking, installing a package will mean that you:

- Ensure that you are in the *path* where you installed. By default this should be 
`/var/www/seat`.

- Put your application into *maintenance mode*. This will ensure that no request from the outside will hit your applications logic, and also help you perform an upgrade uninterrupted. Do this with:

```bash
php artisan down
```

- *Require* the package via composer:

```bash
composer require <package vendor>/<package-name>
```

- *Publish* the assets with artisan:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --force --all
```

- *Run migration* in order to update database:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

- *Clear SeAT cache* after installation:

```bash
php artisan seat:cache:clear
```
- Bring your application *live* and back out of maintenance mode:

```bash
php artisan up
```

Installing packages like this will ensure that none of the core SeAT packages are affected and you should be free to upgrade SeAT core at anytime.
