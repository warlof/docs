## Quick Start

There are many ways to install SeAT. In all cases you will need a dedicated server as a minimum.
Using the docker installation you are free to choose *any* Docker capable host (yes, even Windows!).
However, if you choose to install SeAT on bare metal, you'll need a linux distribution.
We suggest you choose an LTS version of Ubuntu, Debian or CentOS.

### Installation Options

Ignoring the details, to get SeAT installed quickly you have a few options.
All of them will get you SeAT installed, but you still have to manually configure an SSO application on the [EVE Online Developers Portal].

| Method   | Comments     |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Docker   | `bash <(curl -fsSL https://git.io/seat-docker)` <br> This will download and run a [helper script](https://github.com/eveseat/scripts/blob/master/docker-compose/bootstrap.sh) that will ensure `docker` and `docker-compose` is available and start SeAT in containers. |
| Manually | You can always install SeAT by following our [manual installation guide]. All you need is PHP, MariaDB, Redis and a web server and some Linux experience. |

!!! warning

    While installing SeAT - choose one method, and stick to it. Otherwise, you'll get SeAT installed multiple times.
