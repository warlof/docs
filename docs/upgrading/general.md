# General Upgrades

As with anything, it is a **very** good idea to have backups ready before attempting any upgrades.
In the case of SeAT, the most important component needs to be backed up is the SeAT database.
Should something go wrong, then you can simply re-install SeAT, restore the database, and you should be good to go.

## Docker installation

As expected, updates for SeAT are deployed via Dockerhub and the images within the [eveseat organization].
Every package version release will automatically start the build process to generate a new docker image.
This means updates are super simple in the docker world. To update your instance, simply run:

```bash
# Update to the latest dockerhub images
docker-compose pull

# Apply the updates to your instllation
docker-compose up -d

# Cleanup any dangling images
docker image prune -f
```

    **Always** perform a [database backup] of your database before doing an update. Always.

## Blade installation

- Ensure that you are in the path where you installed. By default this should be `/var/www/seat`.
- Put your application into maintenance mode. This will ensure that no request from the outside will hit your applications logic, and also help you perform an upgrade uninterrupted. Do this with:

```bash
php artisan down
```

- Its a good thing to update `composer` itself. This is not a hard requirement, but definitely recommended. Do this with:

```bash
composer self-update
```

- The next thing to do is get the latest SeAT packages. The below example adds the `--no-dev` argument as these packages are generally not needed in production. Upgrade the packages with:

```bash
composer update --no-dev
```

- With the packages upgraded, we can now publish any new migrations/assets/configs. This can be done with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --force --all
```

- Once the needed files are published, run any new/outstanding migrations with:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

- With the migrations done, run the seeders to update any static data:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\Console\\database\\seeds\\ScheduleSeeder
```

- Restart the supervisor workers to ensure they also pickup the latest code:

```bash
supervisorctl restart all
```

- Finally, we can simply bring our application back out of maintenance mode with:

```bash
php artisan up
```

    You can use `mysqldump -uroot -p seat > backup.sql` (change *root* and *seat* according to your configuration)
